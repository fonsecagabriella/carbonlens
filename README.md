# CarbonLens - A Climate and Social Indicators Data Pipeline

**CarbonLens provides a clear lens to explore the intersection of emissions and development. üåé üå±üìä**

This project implements an end-to-end data pipeline that:

- Extracts emissions data from [Climate Trace API](https://climatetrace.org/)
- Extracts social/economic indicators from [World Bank API](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- Loads the datasets into a datalake -> data warehouse
- Transforms the data to be fed to a dashboard
- Visualizes the data in an interactive dashboard

## üåé Project Background
This data engineering project leverages two key global datasets: [Climate Trace emissions](https://climatetrace.org/) data and [World Bank socioeconomic indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/). By combining these complementary datasets, we can explore relationships between countries' carbon footprints and their social/economic development metrics.

### ‚ÄºÔ∏è The Problem
Climate change analysis often lacks integration between emissions data and socioeconomic factors. Researchers and policymakers struggle to connect environmental impact with human development indicators, making it difficult to identify:

- Countries achieving economic growth with lower emissions
- Correlations between emissions and development metrics
- Equitable approaches to emissions reduction based on development status

### ‚úÖ The Goal
Build an end-to-end data pipeline that:

- Extracts emissions data from Climate Trace API for all countries
- Extracts socioeconomic indicators from World Bank API (population, GDP, etc.)
- Integrates these datasets into a unified data warehouse
- Creates a dashboard with visualizations showing key relationships between emissions and development indicators

With the dashboard we should be able to answer questions like:

- How do emissions vary by economic development level?
- Which countries have the highest emissions?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and emissions?
- How has the emissions profile changed over time?

**This will enable data-driven insights into the complex interplay between development and environmental impact across different countries and regions.**

### üìä The Dashboard

The dashboard can be found [on this link](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/e02b247a-e5d1-47d0-a8c3-8b1a254029a2/page/BGa9E).
If at the time of reading this the board is not longer available (GCS is not cheap, after all ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), you can have an impression [by checking here](./dashboard/).

##  Pipeline Flow Structure

This section explains the climate data pipeline architecture, which follows a modern data engineering approach by combining batch data extraction, cloud storage, processing with Spark/Python, transformation with dbt, and visualization in a dashboard. The pipeline integrates climate emissions data from Climate Trace with socioeconomic indicators from the World Bank to analyze relationships between economic development and greenhouse gas emissions.

### Technologies applied

- Airflow: Orchestrates the entire workflow (scheduling, monitoring, and managing tasks).
- GCS (Datalake): Stores the raw Climate Trace data.
- Spark: Processes and transforms large-scale data inside BigQuery.
- dbt: Performs further transformations and modeling for analytics (e.g., cleaning, aggregating).
- BigQuery: Acts as your data warehouse to store both raw and transformed data.
- Looker Studio: Visualizes the processed data to answer project questions.
